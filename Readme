# GiftExchange for a group of people
# This code has hardcoded the number of people in a list
# Additional persons can be added by 'addUser()' API
# The program could be modified to provide output for as many years
# of giftexchange by modifying the following two params:
#    numy =  6  #Gifts can be repeated after numy years
#    yrs = 6    #show results for this number of years

# The program could be automated further to add more persons via command line
# arguments, but due to time constraint it is not implemented below.

# Constraints: Any person should not receive a gift from the same person
# for 3 years in a row. A person should not gift him/herself
